// This would normally be the actual PDF.js worker file
// For now, we'll use a CDN fallback in the component
// In a real deployment, you'd download the worker file from:
// https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@3.11.174/build/pdf.worker.min.js
// and place it in the public directory

// Fallback - the component will handle this gracefully
